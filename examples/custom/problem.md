## Description

We found a file that appears to be encrypted.

## Details

The file is {{url_for('secret.enc', 'here')}}, and someone told us the decryption instructions can be obtained with `nc {{server}} {{port}}`.

## Hints

- It's probably not helpful, but it looks like the build time can be found {{url_for('time.txt', 'here')}}.
